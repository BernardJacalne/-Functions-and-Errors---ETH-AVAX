How It Works
Contract Deployment: The contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
Function Calls: Users interact with the contract functions that implement require(), assert(), and revert().
Condition Checking: Each function checks for specific conditions:
require(): Ensures that the input parameters or contract state meet the required conditions.
assert(): Confirms that the contract state is as expected and no critical errors are present.
revert(): Provides a mechanism to handle multiple conditions and explicitly revert transactions when necessary.
By using these error handling functions, the contract ensures robustness, preventing unintended operations and preserving the integrity of the contract state.

Conclusion
This project serves as an educational example of using require(), assert(), and revert() statements in Solidity smart contracts.
 These functions are essential for building secure and reliable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The included examples demonstrate how to properly handle errors and enforce conditions, contributing to the overall stability 
and security of decentralized applications.
